### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "Iterator" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example is based on the HM (Hideen Machine's) system in the old Pokemon videogames. In which when there is an obstacle specific obstacle, the game checks if any of the Pokemon in your team has an specific attack.

For this process, the game checks each of your Pok√©mon one by one and checks if any of the 4 possible attacks it has is the one it is looking for.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Iterator/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Iterator/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
